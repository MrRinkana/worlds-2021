# worlds-2021

Shows the correct teams and games. No annotations, may add them later but I like it more lean.
https://mrrinkana.github.io/worlds-2021/


Was created because it seemed like the original creator was not publishing an updated version this year, that was incorrect and he has now published his version:
https://rocket3989.github.io/worlds-2021/

Keeping this repo to play around.

Difference from original (except updated teams, dates and some descriptions):
-Google analytics removed
-No annotations
-Donation button will maybe be removed (goes to origninal creator)
