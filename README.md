# worlds-2021

Shows the correct teams and games. No annotations, may add them later but I like it more lean.</br>
https://mrrinkana.github.io/worlds-2021/


Was created because it seemed like the original creator was not publishing an updated version this year, that was incorrect and he has now published his version:</br>
https://rocket3989.github.io/worlds-2021/

Keeping this repo to play around.

Difference from original (except updated teams, dates and some descriptions):</br>
-Google analytics removed</br>
-No annotations</br>
-Donation button is removed (see [a9629bf](https://github.com/MrRinkana/worlds-2021/commit/a9629bfba4ca6e9f651702630e99d763ff08d5cd) for more info)</br>
Please consider doanting to the original creator, by checking out his version (see link earlier).
